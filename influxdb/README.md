# InfluxDB

## It is a timeseries database 
## It is optimized for storing and serving time series through associated pairs of time(s) and value(s)

## Regular timeseries -> data comes at a fixed interval of time
## Irregular timeseries -> data comes at a irregular interval of time -> burst of data (banking transaction during day time)
## A univariate time series has only one variable, a bivariate has two variables, and a multivariate has more than two variables.
